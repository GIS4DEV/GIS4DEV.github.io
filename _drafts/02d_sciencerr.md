title: GIS as Reproducible Science
purpose: "debate whether GIS is a reproducible and replicable science"
---

On Monday, March 8, we will debate:
1. Whether GIS should be considered a science?
1. If/how open source GIS can help with the crisis of reproducibility and replicability in science?

We can debate this in the context of our recent GIS Analysis, related to this ESRI tool for [managing testing sites](https://www.esri.com/en-us/covid-19/response)

The debate will be informed by two readings:

1. Wright, D. J., M. F. Goodchild, and J. D. Proctor. 1997. GIS: Tool or science? Demystifying the persistent ambiguity of GIS as “tool” versus “science.” *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* 87 (2):346–362. [DOI: 10.1111/0004-5608.872057](https://doi.org/10.1111/0004-5608.872057)
1. Please read chapters 2 and 3 (pages 21-43 ) of: <br>
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. *Reproducibility and Replicability in Science*. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. [DOI: 10.17226/25303](https://doi.org/10.17226/25303)

In preparation for/response to the debate, please prepare a reflection/position statement on the two questions in the form of a blog-style post on your GitHub site.
Specifically, you might reflect on:
- Which category of **"GIS as Science"** most applies to the **work you have done** so far in this course or other courses using GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as **"science"**?
- How can **open source GIS** contribute to solving problems of the **reproducibility crisis**?
