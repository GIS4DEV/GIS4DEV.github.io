Wednesday, March 10 Lab

We have a chance to meet for lab in person! There have been many questions about publishing GitHub Pages, polishing model design, and jumping to that "next level" of thinking about spatial interaction models. Therefore our goal for this time will be:

- [ ] Learn how to use the lab space and time (monitors, peripherals, zoom, outlets, etc.)
- [ ] Check installations of GRASS on MacOS and Windows (should be installed with QGIS-- search for GRASS in finder) and install [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/)
- [ ] Verify that you have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and know where local repositories sync
- [ ] Peer review one anothers' GitHub pages ([handout](/assets/peer_review1.pdf))
- [ ] Revise models and GitHub pages
- [ ] [Cognitive Self-reflection](https://forms.gle/3htPX8K8L7pp5Dqp7), a google form with a series of self-reflective and self-evaluative questions. Please take 10 to 15 minutes with this.
- [ ] Explore and evaluate the concept of an open science research compendium as a GitHub repository, e.g. [rosgenrr](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/rosgenrr) Submit questions or suggestions [here](https://forms.gle/6aTnWngJLNRqXuoo9) for improvement or clarification from the perspective of a **student** needing to use the compendium to complete a GIS Analysis.
- [ ] If time allows, move on to Friday's readings and Monday's reading and lecture.
