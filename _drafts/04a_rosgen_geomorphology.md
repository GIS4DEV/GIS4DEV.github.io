Monday, March 15 Asynchronous Lecture

How do geomorphologists use spatial analysis to classify river and stream systems, inferring stream and river system processes from their current form? Let's first learn how geomorphologists "see" river systems, before we replicate their spatial analysis using GIS.

### Guide to Reading (added 3/14)

In this reading, please pay the most attention to:
- 1.0 Introduction: background and motivation for the topic, especially objective #4
- 2.0 Stream Classification Concepts: what are the eight major variables influencing stream morphology?
- 3.0 Stream Classification System: this is the methodology you'll need, and these ideas are illustrated in the video playlist
- Sections 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3 and 6.4 describe many of the practical uses and applications of this classification system
- 7.0 Summary
