## Reading

Please read the following paper, from a human geographer who both researches the social context of GIS technology and uses GIS in original research. In this paper, Schuurman dives into an ethnography of data to illustrate the significance of context and provenance for our day-to-day use of spatial data in research.

  1. Schuurman, N. 2008. Database Ethnographies Using Social Science Methodologies to Enhance Data Analysis and Interpretation. Geography Compass 2 (5):1529â€“1548. [10.1111/j.1749-8198.2008.00150.x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-8198.2008.00150.x)
  
Rather than writing a blog response now, learn from Schuurman's suggestions about how to investigate spatial databases and apply that to your own inquiry into data from Ramani Huria and the Resilience Academy with the links below. Start thinking of research questions that you could ask with this data and investigating the data layers required for those questions. Start documenting your thoughts for use in a lab report next week!
