## Reading

Please read the following paper, which is an analysis of how GIS is typically taught and the implications of this for practicing geography and GIS. 

  1. St. Martin, K., and J. Wing. 2007. The discourse and discipline of GIS. *Cartographica* 42 (3):235â€“248. [10.3138/carto.42.3.235-248](https://doi.org/10.3138/carto.42.3.235-248)

The version of GIS education described by St. Martin and Wing (2007) is the predominant view in the United States. However, it might not seem consistent with your experience at Middlebury.
