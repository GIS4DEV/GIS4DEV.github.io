## Course Description

In this course we will study geographic information science (GIS) with open-source software and critical GIS scholarship. In labs, we will practice techniques to include: data acquisition and preparation for analysis, spatial SQL database queries, automating analysis, spatial interpolation, testing sensitivity to error and uncertainty, and data visualization. We will read and apply critical research of GIS as a subject and with GIS as a methodology. Spatial data sources for labs and independent research projects may include remote sensing, micro-data, smart cities and open government data, and volunteered geographic information (e.g. OpenStreetMap and social media). 

## Learning Goals

-	Survey [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) (Free and Open Source for Geospatial) in terms of its landscape of organizations and projects, research applications, and (radically) unique political economy of knowledge production.
-	Expand your functional knowledge of the nature of geographic information with respect to data standards, structures, metadata, provenance, error, and uncertainty.
-	Creatively apply FOSS4G to address compelling questions in human geography and problems in social and environmental sustainability.
-	Critically reflect on emerging opportunities and ethical dilemmas in open-source geographic information science.
-	Learn how to reproduce existing geographic research and to produce geographic research that is open, reproducible and replicable.
-	Design and communicate research effectively in multiple media, including digital media, reports, presentations, maps, graphs, tables, data, and code.
-	Become competent and confident in conducting research, learning new methods, and overcoming errors, uncertainty, and technical difficulties. Learn to "debug" problems and teach yourself new techniques through structured experimentation.

To be honest, I'm excited to learn and share new open source GIS technologies with you, expanding our imagination for the possibilities in open source, including future research and careers.

## Expectations

- **Inclusivity**: Consciously and actively include yourself and others in learning, participation, collaboration, and discussions. Inclusivity may be achieved through [academic accomodations](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/disability-resource-center/accommodations-and-resources/academic-accommodations) and/or [student resources](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research/student-resources) for learning and research.
- **Academic Honesty**: Open source and open science have a different ethos about intellectual property and its value than most of us are accustomed to. In the first week of class, we will discuss and update our expectations for the honor code and academic honesty in a course focused on open science.
- **Deadlines**: You must always commit the progress that you have made on assignments by the assignment deadline. GIScience projects encounter unforseen challenges or delays while the semester calender marches on.
- **Deadlines at Semester's End**: With many seniors in a spring course, it is not possible to accept late assignment submissions during or after finals week. [Incomplete grades](http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.6.-grades-credits-and-academic-policies/a.6.e.-incomplete-grades) can only be considered for extreme and unexpected circumstances if the student has already completed acceptable work in the majority of assignments.

## Typical Rhythm

- **Monday Lecture**: Learn and practice new GIScience techniques or review/revise techniques from previous challenges.
- **Wednesday Lecture/Discussion**: Set up a lab problem by discussing the problem and its context, significance, implications, etc. This may include assigned reading or research tasks in preparation of a lab problem.
- **Wednesday Evening Lab**: Work together to solve GIScience problems.
- **Friday Discussion**: Read and discuss GIScience research/literature and discuss findings from lab problems.

## Materials & Resources

No required textbook.

Due to health and safety restrictions this spring, you will need your own personal laptop computer to participate in the class. You will need **Windows** or **MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)** or better. You must be willing to install a variety of free software and apply for/subscribe to a variety of free internet-based services, listed below. We will not install or sign up for all of these programs/services at once, but please attempt to get each one running quickly as you are prompted throughout the semester, so that we have ample time to troubleshoot or find alternative solutions.
