Hello and welcome to Open Source Geographic Information Science!

## Learning Goals

•	Survey [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) (Free and Open Source for Geospatial) in terms of its landscape of organizations and projects, research applications, and (radically) unique political economy of knowledge production.
•	Expand your functional knowledge of the nature of geographic information with respect to data standards, structures, metadata, provenance, error, and uncertainty.
•	Creatively apply FOSS4G to address compelling questions in human geography and problems in social and environmental sustainability.
•	Critically reflect on emerging opportunities and ethical dilemmas in open-source geographic information science.
•	Learn how to reproduce existing geographic research and to produce geographic research that is open, reproducible and replicable.
•	Design and communicate research effectively in multiple media, including digital media, reports, presentations, maps, graphs, tables, data, and code.
•	Become competent and confident in conducting research, learning new methods, and overcoming errors, uncertainty, and technical difficulties. Learn to "debug" problems and teach yourself new techniques through structured experimentation.
•	Let's be honest, I'm just excited to learn and share new open source GIS technologies with you, expanding our imagination for the possibilities in open source, including future research and careers.
