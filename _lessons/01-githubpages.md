You can develop a more advanced sites customized for portfolios, blogging, documentation, etc. by first forking or cloning a Jekyll template. Some of these work directly with GitHub pages (building the site remotely on GitHub's servers), while others will require installing requisite software on your own computer to build the site locally.

If you're interested in developing a site with R-Studio and apps or visualizations built in R, an alternative is to create an R-Blogdown site using Hugo and Netlify.
