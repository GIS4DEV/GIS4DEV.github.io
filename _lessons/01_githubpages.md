GitHub is one of many proprietary companies offering services implementing Git, making it more convenient to use and providing web servers for backing up and sharing repositories.

Some of these work directly with GitHub pages (building the site remotely on GitHub's servers), while others will require installing requisite software on your own computer to build the site locally. Here are some places to start:
