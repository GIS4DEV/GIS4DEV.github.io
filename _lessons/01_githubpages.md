## Git

Lost documents? Collaboration mishaps? Having multitudes of documents named things like `thesis_final_final_final2_noreallytrulythefinaldraft.docx`? GO ON, [GIT!](https://git-scm.com/) rediculously outdated and unreliable file systems for managing projects and false sense of recycle bin security, and go back to the floppy disks and CD-RW drives where you came from. Try not to hit `SHIFT + DEL` on your way outta here. [#FallonTonight](https://www.youtube.com/c/fallontonight/search?query=go%20on%20git)

- Git is open-source software code for using version control for digital repositories and facilitating collaboration.
- Git can be run from the command line or from a simple GUI (graphical user interface) 
- [GitHub](https://github.com) is one of many proprietary companies offering services implementing Git, making it more convenient to use and providing web servers for backing up and sharing repositories.
  - The [GitHub](https://github.com) web application provides many of Git's  editing and version control features without downloading any sofware.
  - GitHub is a popular platform for hositng open-source software projects, including [QGIS](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS).

## GitHub Pages

- https://desktop.github.com/ GitHub software to run Git on with a GUI on your Desktop
- https://github.com/pages-themes List of all the GitHub Pages themes with links to their repositories, where you can find additional documentation on how to use and customize each theme
- https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages GitHub's documentation about pages
- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ Essential cheat-sheet for writing Markdown

## Fancier Options

You can develop a more advanced sites customized for portfolios, blogging, documentation, etc. by first forking or cloning a Jekyll template. Some of these work directly with GitHub pages (building the site remotely on GitHub's servers), while others will require installing requisite software on your own computer to build the site locally. Here are some places to start:

- https://jekyllrb.com/ home of the Jekyll project, with good documentation and tutorials
- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ a quick introduction and start-up guide
- https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now this theme is easy to fork to start your own pages repository, and the readme contains step-by-step instructions for doing so
- https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/ Yihui Xie's book explains the R Blogdown / Hugo / Netlify stack for GitHub pages using R-Studio and integrating visualizations and apps built in R. Bonus: it's very similar to [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) for creating publications with your research in R.
