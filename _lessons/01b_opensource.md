Please read some background on open source in Geography for class discussion on Friday, February 26.

While you read these, consider:
- What are the meanings of *free software*, *open source*, and *open science*?
- In what way might something be "open source" but not "free"?
- Is there space for Open GIScience in an undergraduate liberal arts education?
- What risks/benefits do you see for use of open source GIS in science? In government? In private businesses?

Please write a response/reaction to this material on your GitHub site.
