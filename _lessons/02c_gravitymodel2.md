title: "Gravity Model: Finalize & Publish"
purpose: "complete a solution for the Gravity model and publish to GitHub"
---

In our afternoon lecture time, our *asynchronous* tasks will be to:

- finalize the gravity model work
- follow a tutorial on publishing the work to GitHub, ultimately including:
  - a `model3` file for the gravity model of spatial interaction
  - a `model3` file for preprocessing hospital data
  - a GitHub page detailing
    - purpose of the models
	- data sources and references, including appropriate links
    - reproducible documentation of methods, where documentation includes
      - images of the models
	  - links to the `model3` model files
	- interpretation of model results *vis-a-vis* the Dartmouth Health Atlas
  - a static map and a web map of your results with four layers
    - hospitals
	- calculated hospital catchments
	- hospital catchments given by the Dartmouth Atlas (you may exclude this one from your static map)
	- population density

Before class on Monday, please complete:

- a gravity model implementation and page on GitHub
- reading on GIS as a (replicable) Science with a blog-style page on GitHub (see next lesson)
