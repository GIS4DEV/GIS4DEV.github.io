title: GIS as Reproducible Science
purpose: "debate whether GIS is a reproducible and replicable science"
---

On Monday, March 8, we will debate:
1. Whether GIS should be considered a science?
1. If/how open source GIS can help with the crisis of reproducibility and replicability in science?

The debate will be informed by two readings:

1. Wright, D. J., M. F. Goodchild, and J. D. Proctor. 1997. GIS: Tool or science? Demystifying the persistent ambiguity of GIS as “tool” versus “science.” *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* 87 (2):346–362. [DOI: 10.1111/0004-5608.872057](https://doi.org/10.1111/0004-5608.872057)
1. Please read chapters 2 and 3 (pages 21-43 ) of: <br>
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. *Reproducibility and Replicability in Science*. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. [DOI: 10.17226/25303](https://doi.org/10.17226/25303)

In advance of the debate, please prepare a reflection/position statement on the two questions in the form of a blog-style post on your GitHub site.
