Wednesday, March 10 Lab

We have a chance to meet for lab in person! There have been many questions about publishing GitHub Pages, polishing model design, and jumping to that "next level" of thinking about spatial interaction models. Therefore our goal for this time will be:

- Learn how to use the lab space and time
- Peer review one anothers' GitHub pages (link with details coming)
- Revise models and GitHub pages
- Critical Self-reflection (link with details coming)
- Check installations of GRASS on MacOS and Windows and install R-Studio
- Explore and evaluate the concept of an open science research compendium (link with details coming)
- If time allows, move on to Friday's readings and Monday's reading and lecture.
