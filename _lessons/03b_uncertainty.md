Friday, March 12 Discussion

## Reading

Recall that the NASEM (2019) report reading included some dicussion of *error*, *precision*, and *uncertainty*. Please review those concepts.

Please read:

1. Longley, P. A., M. F. Goodchild, D. J. Maguire, and D. W. Rhind. 2008. Geographical information systems and science 2nd ed. Chichester: Wiley. (only chapter 6: Uncertainty, pages 127-153)

## Reflecting

I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:
1. Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
1. What responsibilties do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?
1. What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?
