title: Rosgen Classification of Stream Geomorphology
purpose: "learn how geomorphologists apply spatial concepts to understand streams"
---

Monday, March 15 Asynchronous Lecture

How do geomorphologists use spatial analysis to classify river and stream systems, inferring stream and river system processes from their current form? Let's first learn how geomorphologists "see" river systems, before we replicate their spatial analysis using GIS.
