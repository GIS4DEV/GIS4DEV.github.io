## Reading

The following paper will help contextualize our work on reproducing a Rosgen Classification method, and should serve as an important reference in your lab report.

### Draft Report Outline
**Due: March 22 at noon**

**this is still a draft -- to be moved into the rosgenrr repository prior to lab**

- Finalize the Rosgen Stream Classification for your data point(s)
- Follow the tutorial on publishing the work to GitHub, ultimately including:
- A table that reports the parameters you input into the model
- Thorough documentation for processing a Rosgen Stream Classification
- A GitHub page detailing
  - Purpose of the classification
  - Data sources and references, including appropriate links
  - Reproducible documentation of methods, where documentation includes:
  - Annotated flowchart of final parameter values (use last page of RSC_EPA_2005 PDF)
  - Images of the longitudinal profile plot with the three different attempts, the close up plot where you found the flood-prone width, and a map of your point.
  - Response to the following prompt: Quantifying uncertainty in geomorphic systems and in GIScience is of paramount importance, not only for creating error bars on a graph, but for realistically communicating the reliability and legitimacy of an output dataset. Error bars do not (necessarily) reflect on the researcher. They stem from collection constraints, processing constraints, subjective decision making, and many, many more sources. Given what you have learned in this module, discuss three sources of uncertainty that could impact the classification of your stream. Where does it stem from? Why is it a problem? What could be done to fix it or reduce it? In a perfect world, how could this uncertainty be removed?
