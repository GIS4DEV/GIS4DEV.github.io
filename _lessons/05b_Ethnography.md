## Reading

Please read the following paper, from a human geographer who both researches the social context of GIS technology and uses GIS in original research. In this paper, Schuurman dives into an ethnography of data to illustrate the significance of context and provenance for our day-to-day use of spatial data in research.

## OpenStreetMap and Ramani Huria / Resilience Academy

OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/-6.8162/39.2203
Ramani Huria: http://ramanihuria.org/
Ramani Huria open street map wiki guide: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam/Ramani_Huria
There are several stories about Ramani Huria here: https://opendri.org/tag/tanzania/ 
Resilience Academy, a Ramani Huria project: https://resilienceacademy.ac.tz/
    update: you can add Resilience Academy data to QGIS as either raster WMS or vector WFS layers with these links, found in the metadata, e.g. of Open Areas: https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/layers/geonode:dar_es_salaam_open_areas/metadata_detail
    WMS raster: https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/geoserver/ows
    WFS features: https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/geoserver/ows

What do you want to know about this data before you start using it for analysis? Start taking notes for / writing up a review of data sources for an analytical report on flood risk in Dar es Salaam...

    What data is available on: a) flood risk, b) flood risk management, e.g. stormwater drains / dams, etc. c) characteristics of urban residential settlements (e.g. location vis a vis risk, poverty/wealth, crowding or population density, accessibility for emergency vehicles), and d) resources for emergencies, e.g. hospitals, fire stations, police stations, shelters...
    In particular, how are the features we want to use for analysis tagged, and how were they created?
