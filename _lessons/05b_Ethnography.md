## Reading

Please read the following paper, from a human geographer who both researches the social context of GIS technology and uses GIS in original research. In this paper, Schuurman dives into an ethnography of data to illustrate the significance of context and provenance for our day-to-day use of spatial data in research.

  1. Schuurman, N. 2008. Database Ethnographies Using Social Science Methodologies to Enhance Data Analysis and Interpretation. Geography Compass 2 (5):1529â€“1548. [10.1111/j.1749-8198.2008.00150.x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-8198.2008.00150.x)
  
Rather than writing a blog response now, learn from Schuurman's suggestions about how to investigate spatial databases and apply that to your own inquiry into data from Ramani Huria and the Resilience Academy with the links below. Start thinking of research questions that you could ask with this data and investigating the data layers required for those questions. Start documenting your thoughts for use in a lab report next week!
  
## OpenStreetMap and Ramani Huria / Resilience Academy

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/-6.8162/39.2203)
- [Ramani Huria](http://ramanihuria.org/)
- Ramani Huria open street map [wiki guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam/Ramani_Huria)
- There are several stories about Ramani Huria [here](https://opendri.org/tag/tanzania/)
- [Resilience Academy](https://resilienceacademy.ac.tz/), a Ramani Huria project with WMS raster and WFS feature services at https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/geoserver/ows

**Question:** What do you want to know about this data before you start using it for analysis? Start taking notes for / writing up a review of data sources for an analytical report on flood risk in Dar es Salaam... What data is available with regards to the following issues, and how was that data created? How are the features we want to use for analysis tagged in OpenStreetMap, and how were they created?

- flood risk
- flood risk management, e.g. stormwater drains / dams, etc.
- characteristics of urban residential settlements (e.g. location vis a vis risk, poverty/wealth, crowding or population density, accessibility for emergency vehicles)
- resources for emergencies, e.g. hospitals, fire stations, police stations, shelters...
