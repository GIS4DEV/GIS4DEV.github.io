## Prepare a Repository for the Reproduction Attempt

1. Prior to class, each group should have one complete workflow in a markdown `.md` text document.
1. `Fork` the `RP-Malcomb` repository.
1. Share the repository amongst your group.
1. Have one person `clone` it to their computer.
1. Add your preanalysis plan markdown to the repository. 
1. `Commit` and `push` this change.
1. Make a new `branch` of the repository named `v2-data`

## Investigate Data Sources

Now, it's time to investigate the data sources for the Malcomb et al (2014) study!

I suggest you divide up the task of investigating and describing the data sources and, based on what you find, revising the preanalysis plan. One way to slice it would be to use Table 2 to divide the task by:

- Assets
- Access
- Livelihood Sensitivity
- Physical Exposure

As each person finishes their section, join others with more complex data or rotate data sources. Make sure each data source gets a look by at least one person, and by the end, everyone should agree on the new preanalysis plan.

1. Make amendments to your preanalysis plan markdown document and commit the changes to the `v2-data` branch.
1. The commits can be made all at once, or sequentially.
1. Merge the `v2-data` branch into the `v1-preanalysis` branch.
