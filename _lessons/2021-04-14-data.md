## Investigate Data Sources & Revisit / Discuss Workflow

Now, it's time to investigate the data sources for the Malcomb et al (2014) study!

I suggest you divide up the task of investigating and describing the data sources and, based on what you find, revising the preanalysis plan. One way to slice it would be to use Table 2 to divide the task by:

- Assets
- Access
- Livelihood Sensitivity available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RKVGitv4HxFuCylYps-gGkt6OK4oAjJa/view?usp=sharing) for Middlebury students only.
- Physical Exposure

As each person finishes their section, join others with more complex data or rotate data sources. Make sure each data source gets a look by at least one person, and by the end, everyone should agree on the new preanalysis plan.

1. Make amendments to your preanalysis plan markdown document.
1. It should be possible for different group members to work simultaneously, as long as they work on different sections of the document.
1. When you are finished, create a second `release` titled `RP-Malcomb-Preanalysis-Plan-Data` and note in the description that this preanalysis plan was amended after investigating all data sources for the study, but prior to starting any analysis.
