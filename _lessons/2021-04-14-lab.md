title: Malawi Preliminary Analysis
purpose: "study and execute R code for the analysis"
---

## Build on the shoulders of your predecessors

Your starting point for this lab analysis will be the code developed over the spring and summer of 2020.
In the spring, we solved the problem using spatial SQL queries in PostGIS for the vector analysis, and then we completed the raster analysis using graphic modeler to run GDAL tools in QGIS.
Over the summer, Kufre Udoh worked on translating all of the SQL queries and QGIS graphic models into R.
At the time, we still did not have the final 20% of data from FEWSnet, and thus also could not truly assess our results with expectations of success.

## But pay attention...

As you execute the R code, thoroughly compare the code to your analysis plan, and work on integrating the two such that by the end of lab, the analysis plan is identical to the code. Use your best judgement to decide whether to revise the code or to revise your plan.

## Prepare a Repository for the Reproduction Attempt

1. Prior to class, each group should have one complete workflow in a markdown `.md` text document.
1. `Fork` the `RP-Malcomb` repository. (Wait to do this until Wednesday LAB time!)
1. Share the repository amongst your group.
1. Have one person `clone` it to their computer.
1. Add your preanalysis plan markdown to the repository. 
1. `Commit` and `push` this change.
1. Create a new `release` of the repository online, titled `RP-Malcomb-Preanalysis-Plan` and note in the description that this preanalysis was formulated without accessing any data for the study.

## Investigate Data Sources

Now, it's time to investigate the data sources for the Malcomb et al (2014) study!

I suggest you divide up the task of investigating and describing the data sources and, based on what you find, revising the preanalysis plan. One way to slice it would be to use Table 2 to divide the task by:

- Assets
- Access
- Livelihood Sensitivity available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RKVGitv4HxFuCylYps-gGkt6OK4oAjJa/view?usp=sharing) for Middlebury students only.
- Physical Exposure

As each person finishes their section, join others with more complex data or rotate data sources. Make sure each data source gets a look by at least one person, and by the end, everyone should agree on the new preanalysis plan.

1. Make amendments to your preanalysis plan markdown document.
1. It should be possible for different group members to work simultaneously, as long as they work on different sections of the document.
1. When you are finished, create a second `release` titled `RP-Malcomb-Preanalysis-Plan-Data` and note in the description that this preanalysis plan was amended after investigating all data sources for the study, but prior to starting any analysis.
