title: Malawi Preliminary Analysis
purpose: "study and execute R code for the analysis"

## Build on the shoulders of your predecessors

Your starting point for this lab analysis will be the code developed over the spring and summer of 2020.
In the spring, we solved the problem using spatial SQL queries in PostGIS for the vector analysis, and then we completed the raster analysis using graphic modeler to run GDAL tools in QGIS.
Over the summer, Kufre Udoh worked on translating all of the SQL queries and QGIS graphic models into R.
At the time, we still did not have the final 20% of data from FEWSnet, and thus also could not truly assess our results with expectations of success.

## But pay attention...

As you execute the R code, thoroughly compare the code to your analysis plan, and work on integrating the two such that by the end of lab, the analysis plan is identical to the code. Use your best judgement to decide whether to revise the code or to revise your plan.
