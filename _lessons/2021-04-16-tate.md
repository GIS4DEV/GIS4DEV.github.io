## Reading

Tate, E. 2013. Uncertainty Analysis for a Social Vulnerability Index. *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* 103 (3):526â€“543. [doi:10.1080/00045608.2012.700616](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00045608.2012.700616).

## Analysis

As you read Tate (2013), consider the following:

- Which of the model structures described by Tate was used in Malcomb et al (2014)?
- What decisions were made by Malcomb et al (2014) at each of the steps illustrated by Tate in Figure 1, and elaborated in the *Sources of Uncertainty* section?
- Does Tate give you any ideas about how to evaluate your reproduction of the Malcomb et al (2014) study in terms of:
  - sources of uncertainty
  - methods to compare your results with the orginial study results

Write down your notes as you read and as we discuss the paper in class so that you can use them in your report on the Malcomb et al (2014) reproduction. You don't need a seperate blog post for this, but you do need to learn from and cite Tate's paper in your report on the Malcomb et al (2014) reproduction.
