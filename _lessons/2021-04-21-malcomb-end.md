purpose: "complete, compare and interpret the replication study"
---

## Lecture

In lecture, we will strategize and workflow-plan how to:
- complete the livelihood sensitivity (FEWSnet) portion of the Malcomb et al (2014) study
- address remaining sources of uncertainty in our reproduction study

## Lab

In lab we will:
- complete a reproduction of Malcomb et al (2014) !
- import and map a digital replica of the Malcomb et al published maps
- adjust our methods to fit the results of Malcomb et al as well as we can

The final report will be due on Monday. Give credit to peers for their contributions and finalize independently.
The final analysis will reach the point of completing a reproduction of figures 3 and 4 and quantitatively comparing those results with the published maps in the paper. On Friday, we will discuss a strategy for this quantitative comparison.
