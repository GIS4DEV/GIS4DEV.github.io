Please read:

Wang, Z., X. Ye, and M. H. Tsou. 2016. Spatial, temporal, and content analysis of Twitter for wildfire hazards. *Natural Hazards* 83 (1):523â€“540. DOI:[10.1007/s11069-016-2329-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-016-2329-6)

When reading, focus on:

* What are the main benefits and challenges of working with spatial Twitter data?
* What types of analysis were applied and how were the results presented? (i.e. types of graphs, statistics, tables)
* Do you think the reserach is *reproducible*? (same data, same results)
* Do you think the research is *replicable*? (new case and data, verified findings)

Please summarize your thoughts in a blog post.
