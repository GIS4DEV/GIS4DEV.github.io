title: Comparing Choropleth Maps
purpose: "learn methods to quantitatively assess Choropleth map agreement and accuracy"
---

Friday, April 23

Prior to Friday's class, you should have:

* complete reproduction of Malcomb et al in R
* digital replicas of Malcomb et al's published maps in R

## Comparing Choropleth Maps

Today, we'll investigate the question of how to compare choropleth maps for agreement between the maps or for assessment of accuracy.

* Wikipedia [Spearman's Rank Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
* STHDA [Correlation Tests in R] (http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/correlation-test-between-two-variables-in-r)
* R [corr function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/emulator/versions/1.2-20/topics/corr)

## What is an API?

Application Program Interface! Examples:

- https://api.dhsprogram.com
- https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html
- https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api

If an API is useful for data science, it's common to find an R package allowing you to connect to that API

- https://cran.r-project.org/package=rdhs
- https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidycensus
- https://cran.rstudio.com/package=rtweet

## Set up Twitter Developer API Account

**Important!** To proceed with the next GIS analysis, you will need a Twitter Developer API Account. Apply for this account today! Sometimes the application is initially rejected... so don't delay.

## Using Releases, Tags and Compare in GitHub

* Will post a short video on how to take advantage of these features to help in report-writing.
