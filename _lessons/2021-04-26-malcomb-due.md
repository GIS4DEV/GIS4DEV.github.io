## Using and Comparing Releases in GitHub

- [video](https://midd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d3c84a23-1053-498f-9450-ad16000384c6)
- [demo repository](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/releasecompare)
- Note: I've noticed that if you use automatic list or outline numbering and make a revision in an early line, you wind up having a change tracked for every line because of renumbering. Additionally, it will be easier for GitHub to track changes for many short lines, rather than long paragraphs.
