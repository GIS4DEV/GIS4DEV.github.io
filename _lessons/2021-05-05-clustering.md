## Before Lab   

Before next Lab, make a copy of the `01-search-dorian.r` script in your `RE-Dorian` repository and modify it to query your own set of data from Twitter and prepare it for mapping just as we have done here!

You may modify both the search terms and the geographic extent of the search.

Remember that you may have to let the query run for a few hours if there are a high number of results.

This type of analysis is highly dependent on trending twitter activity over the past week. Create a query that will result in many thousands of tweets in the United States.

## Lab

Complete a spatial analysis of clustering in Twitter data.
