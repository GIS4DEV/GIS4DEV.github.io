For Friday, May 7

Today, Professor Holler must participate in a full-day NSF Panel. 

## Webinars on Geospatial Research and COVID-19

Therefore, please watch a research webinar on cutting edge COVID research using big data analysis with movement vectors to study the spatial epidemiology of the disease.

Specific video link and question prompts TBD. Two options:

- Xun Shi's talk for the GSI Covid Fellowship on [Monday, April 26](https://gsi.cigi.illinois.edu/geospatial-fellows-webinar-series/)
- Mei-Po Kwan's talk for the [American Geographical Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDpa3c5ljsA)

Please summarize your thoughts in a blog post in preparation for debates on [May 14](2021-5-14-rr-ethics). See the [May 14](2021-5-14-rr-ethics) page for guidance on blog post content.

In the debates, some of you will focus on **Xun Shi**'s talk, and some on **Mei-Po Kwan**'s.
Some of you will **introduce** the content of the talk from a **neutral** point of view and then **moderate** the debate.
Some of you will debate in favor of **expansion** of capabilities and applications for spatial big data research.
Others will debate in favor of **curtailing** and limiting spatial big data research.
In your arguments, be sure to raise theoretically-informed arguments about **ethics** *and* **reproducibility**.
