## Debate Preparation

In preparation for the debate, watch your [assigned talk](2021-05-07-covid-webinar) and draw theoretical arguments from prior readings and any of the references and ethical standards cited below. Prepare for your debate with one blog post of 2-3 paragraphs. You may strategically focus blog post content on different aspects of debate positions amongst those assigned the same roles. For those of you assigned to introduce and moderate, use the blog post to briefly summarize the talks and to think of good questions to pose in the debate.

## Debate Format

This is the format for each of the debates:

- 3 minute introductory overview the research talk
- 3 minute position statement by those in favor of expanding
- 3 minute position statement by those in favor of curtailing
- 14 minutes of moderated questions and debate by the intro team, delegating each side equal time to respond
- 1 minute closing statement by each side

One person from the Mei Po Kwan intro group should help keep time throughout the debates.
