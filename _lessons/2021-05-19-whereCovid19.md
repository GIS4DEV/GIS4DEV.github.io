Wednesday, May 19

## Lecture

- Review GitHub repositories and course standing
- Strategize revisions to the Kang et al 2020 reproduction

## Lab

In lab, your goal will be to:

- It might help to also clone your respository to your local computer to inspect the data sources or any outputs you create in QGIS.
- Make some (modest) improvements to the Where COVID-19 notebook and repository (ideas based on lecture discussion)
- Push changes from CyberGISX to your GitHub Repository
- Publish a report for the reproduction analysis (ouline below)
- Based on class discussion, your reproduction of this study should include three interventions:
1. Additional code comments and/or markdown explanations of the methods as you understand them (your work from May 12)
1. Fix for one major error in the current version of the code.
1. Address any one minor contribution you wish to make.

### Report Outline

- **Introduction** explaining the interest and purpose in reproducing the Kang et al (2020) study, and very briefly introducing what the study was about.
- **Materials and Methods** briefly explaining and citing what data sources and computational resources were used for the study.  The length/depth of this explanation may be similar to your review of the Twitter for Wildfire Hazards paper (Wang et al 2016). Explain any changes you made to the original python notebook / repository.
- **Results and Discussion** include images of findings (maps, graphs) and link to your final repository for the reproduction. Discuss what you learned from the reproduction attempt, especially any knowledge, insight, or uncertainty that was *encoded in the repository* or *discovered in the reproduction* but not *explained in the published paper*.
- **Conclusions** with emphasis on the significance of the reproduction study you just completed. Was the study reproducible, and has the reproduction study increased, decreased, or otherwise refined your belief in the validity of the original study? Conclude with any insights, priorities, or questions for future research.
- **Note on Style**: Remember that the primary motivation for reproduction and replication studies is not punitive. Frame your discussions in this report and previous reports in the constructive motivation for improving scientific knowledge through peer review. Project like CyberGISX generally, and the Kang et al 2020 publication specifically, are *very new* in geography, and our engagement with them should be both *encouraging* and *constructive* while emphasizing the *value of open science*.

### Ideas for modest contributions

- There are other models besides two-step catchment analysis for spatial interaction in health geography, e.g. gravity model.
- How important or efficient is the network simplification function?
- Clarify use of packages and functions throughout the code
- Could area-weighted reaggregation be used for the overlap analysis?
- Why are hexagons used for the analysis as opposed to other spatial data structures, e.g. raster squares? In other words, is there a modifiable areal unit problem?
- How are weights justified for the enhanced distance bands? Would different weights significantly change outcomes?
- Filter hopstial types in the code, rather than beforehand.
- Should the default network speed be set to 35mph?
- Could other forms of transit be included?
