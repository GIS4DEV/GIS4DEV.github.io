## Lecture

Collaborating to more deeply understand the Python script for this analysis and identify opportunities for improving and extending its functionality, especially to more completely implement the analysis in the published research paper.

## Lab

In lab, we will improve the Python notebook for the Where COVID-19 study and apply it to solve spatial accessibility with a slightly different set of inputs, either translating to a different region or translating to different variables and parameters in the same region.
