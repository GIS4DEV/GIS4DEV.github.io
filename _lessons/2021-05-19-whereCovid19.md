## Lecture

- Review GitHub repositories and course standing
- Strategize revisions to the Kang et al 2020 reproduction

## Lab

In lab, your goal will be to:

- Make some (modest) improvements to the Where COVID-19 notebook and repository (ideas based on lecture discussion)
- Push changes from CyberGISX to your GitHub Repository
- Publish a blog post/report for the reproduction analysis

### Report Outline

- **Introduction** explaining the interest and purpose in reproducing the Kang et al (2020) study, and very briefly introducing what the study was about.
- **Materials and Methods** briefly explaining and citing what data sources and computational resources were used for the study. Explain any changes you made to the original python notebook / repository.
- **Results and Discussion** include images of findings (maps, graphs) and link to your final repository for the reproduction. Discuss what you learned from the reproduction attempt, especially any knowledge, insight, or uncertainty that was *encoded in the repository* or *discovered in the reproduction* but not *explained in the published paper*.
- **Conclusions** with emphasis on the significance of the reproduction study you just completed. Was the study reproducible, and has the reproduction study increased, decreased, or otherwise refined your belief in the validity of the original study? Conclude with any insights, priorities, or questions for future research.
