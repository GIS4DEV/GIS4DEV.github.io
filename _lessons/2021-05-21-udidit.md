Friday, May 21

## Whoa!

Today is the final day of class together. We need to celebrate and review our accomplishments!

But, there is *always* still more to learn...

We scratched the surface of several different technology platforms for reproducible spatial research:

- QGIS
- GRASS
- PostGIS
- R
- Python

The wonderful thing is that these platforms all have much of their code base in common, thanks to [OGC](https://www.ogc.org/) and fundamental code libraries like [PROJ](https://proj.org), [GDAL](http://gdal.org/), and [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/). Moreover, there are plenty of free and low-cost training resources for each of these platforms online, and you are free to keep using all of this software on your personal computer!

What you *don't* get from the tutorials is:
- best practices for critical geospatial research
- how these technological tools relate to theory and methods in geography and other academic disciplines
- strategies for coping with error and uncertainty
- a sense of how GIS tools fit within the bigger picture of a full research project from beginning to end
- critical awareness of how GIS technology is causally interrelated with society and the environment

That's what we achieved through the lens of reproductions and replications and our critical Friday discussions. With that background in place, I welcome you to a lifetime of continued learning... 

Where can you learn more on your own, to be more deeply prepared for work in any one of these technologies? This list will expand over time:

- [Data Carpentry Workshops](https://datacarpentry.org/) with free data science workshops
- [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) with low-cost digital books, often accompanied by video tutorials
- [LinkedIn Learning](https://go.middlebury.edu/lil/) with Lynda tutorial videos for Middlebury students

## Ownership in Open Science

This is something to think about...
