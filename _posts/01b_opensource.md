While you read these, consider:
- **As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for learning, the honor code, and evaluation/grades?**
- What are the meanings of *free software*, *open source*, and *open science*?
- How is *free* as in the free software movement different from *free* as in a cost of `$0.00`?
- In what way might something be *open source* but not *free*?
- As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for:
  - Learning
  - The [Honor Code](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tVzZVTJc_IE5jIMPG5JadQe0j0R_yYPscNzGtqiq3ak/edit?usp=sharing) (link for Middlebury community only)
  - Evaluation & Grades
- Is there space for Open GIScience in an undergraduate liberal arts education?
- What risks/benefits do you see for use of open source GIS in:
  - science?
  - government?
  - private businesses?

Please write a response/reaction to this material on your GitHub site. GitHub site and Open GIScience post are due on *Monday March 1*.
