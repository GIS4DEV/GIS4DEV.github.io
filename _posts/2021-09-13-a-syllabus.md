## Course Description

In this course we will study geographic information science (GIS) with open-source software and critical GIS scholarship.
In labs, we will practice techniques to include: data acquisition and preparation for analysis, spatial SQL database queries, automating analysis, spatial interpolation, testing sensitivity to error and uncertainty, and data visualization.
We will read and apply critical research of GIS as a subject and with GIS as a methodology.
Spatial data sources for labs and independent research projects may include remote sensing, micro-data, smart cities and open government data, and volunteered geographic information (e.g. OpenStreetMap and social media).

Prerequisite: GEOG0120 *Human Geography with GIS*.
Programming experience is *not assumed or required*!
You just need to be willing to learn how to translate the spatial analysis that you know from desktop GIS (QGIS, ArcGIS, etc.) into code.

## Learning Goals

-	Survey [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) (Free and Open Source for Geospatial) in terms of its landscape of organizations and projects, research applications, and (radically) unique political economy of knowledge production.
-	Expand your functional knowledge of the nature of geographic information with respect to data standards, structures, metadata, provenance, error, and uncertainty.
-	Creatively apply FOSS4G to address compelling questions in human geography and problems in social and environmental sustainability.
-	Critically reflect on emerging opportunities and ethical dilemmas in open-source geographic information science.
-	Learn how to reproduce existing geographic research and to produce geographic research that is open, reproducible and replicable.
-	Design and communicate research effectively in multiple media, including digital media, reports, presentations, maps, graphs, tables, data, and code.
-	Become competent and confident in conducting research, learning new methods, and overcoming errors, uncertainty, and technical difficulties.
Learn to "debug" problems and teach yourself new techniques through structured experimentation.

## Expectations

- **Inclusivity**: Consciously and actively include yourself and others in learning, participation, collaboration, and discussions.
Inclusivity may be achieved through [academic accomodations](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/disability-resource-center/accommodations-and-resources/academic-accommodations) and/or [student resources](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research/student-resources) for learning and research.
Accommodations and correspondence about them are confidential.
- **Academic Honesty**: Open source and open science have a different ethos about intellectual property and its value than most of us are accustomed to.
In the first two weeks of class, we will discuss and update our expectations for the [honor code and academic honesty](c-honorcode) in a course focused on open science.
- **Deadlines**: You must always commit the progress that you have made on assignments by the assignment deadline. In case unforeseen challenges or delays have prevented full completion of an assignment, you are required to record the progress that you have made, describe the barrier(s) encountered and anything you have learned about it/them, and propose a solution.
- **End of Semester**: Your body of work for the course must be complete on GitHub Pages by the end of finals week. [Incomplete grades](http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.6.-grades-credits-and-academic-policies/a.6.e.-incomplete-grades) can only be considered if extreme/unexpected circumstances arise in the final weeks of the semester and if the majority of assignments have already been satisfactorily completed.

## Student Work & Evaluation

Open science requires researchers, universities, and publishers to change the way they value intellectual work and intellectual property, and the same goes for instructors and students.
Traditional means of evaluating and grading student work that are based on individualism, competition, and secrecy are counterproductive to an open science learning environment.

Throughout this course you will develop a set of your own personal pages and repositories on GitHub.
Those personal pages will also contain intellectual contributions from your classmates, instructors, other researchers, and even students from previous classes.

## Typical Rhythm

- **Tuesday Lecture**: Learn and practice new GIScience techniques or review/revise techniques from previous challenges.
- **Wednesday Lecture/Discussion**: Set up a lab problem by discussing the problem and its context, significance, implications, etc. This may include assigned reading or research tasks in preparation of a lab problem.
- **Wednesday Evening Lab**: Work together on GIScience analyses.
- **Friday Discussion**: Read and discuss GIScience research/literature and discuss findings from lab problems.

## Materials & Resources

There is no required textbook.

Digital materials will be provided on this site and in other repositories of the [GIS4DEV GitHub Organization](https://github.com/gis4dev), including a private repository for [literature](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/literature).

You must be willing to use a variety of free software and apply for/subscribe to a variety of free internet-based services, listed below.
We will not install or sign up for all of these programs/services at once, but please attempt to get each one running quickly as you are prompted throughout the semester, so that we have ample time to troubleshoot or find alternative solutions.

## General Expectations for GIScience Analyses

- Write up a summary and interpretation of the analysis.
- Include methods documentation to support full reproducibility.
This is most easily achieved by having legible code with good comments.
- Visualize results with maps and/or graphs and interpret findings.
