## Discussion

While you read these, consider:
- What are the meanings of *free software*, *open source*, and *open science*?
- How is *free* as in the free software movement different from *free* as in a cost of `$0.00`?
- In what way might something be *open source* but not *free*?
- As we practice Open GIScience in this class, what are the implications for:
  - Learning
  - The [Honor Code](09/14/honorcode)
  - Evaluation & Grades
- Is there space for Open GIScience in an undergraduate liberal arts education?
- What risks/benefits do you see for use of open source GIS in:
  - science?
  - government?
  - private businesses?

## A 'Show Me the Code' Example: Distance Matrix in QGIS

The `Distance Matrix` [algorithm documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectoranalysis.html#distance-matrix) says nothing about how it calculates distances!

Watch a [video](https://midd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=855206e6-2da2-4879-b86a-acdf016865e4) of the issue, and/or follow the notes below.

### Reading code to understand an algorithm

- Go to the QGIS GitHub repository [github.com/qgis](https://github.com/qgis) and search for `distancematrix` within the repository
- distance matrix algorithm [source code](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/f32725658f205af4ac9718d3a3b74f13eaa98d3e/python/plugins/processing/algs/qgis/PointDistance.py)
  - line 179: Transforms the target features into the source CRS (coordinate reference system)
  - line 182: CRS set to source CRS
  - line 183: Ellipsoid set to context ellipsoid
- distance area class [source code](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/5caa3880ff5e85df9116d191863809c6851644c8/src/core/qgsdistancearea.cpp)
  - line 413: converts to meters
  - the only information passed to `qgisdistancearea` is the context ellipsoid and transformation, and the source crs
- The API (application programming interface) guide can also be a quick and helpful reference to QGIS variables [qgis.org/api](https://qgis.org/api/classQgsProcessingContext.html)
  - there is a `context.ellipsoid()` and a `context.distanceUnit()`, but the distance matrix algorithm never uses `distanceUnit`.

### Conclusions

- `Distance Matrix` appears to calculate distance in `meters`, no matter what.
- Target features are automatically re-projected to match the CRS of input features
- If the input layer uses a projected coordinate system, that system is used or planar distance calculation.
- If the input layer uses a geographic coordinate system, the project ellipsoid is used for ellipsoidal distance calculation.
