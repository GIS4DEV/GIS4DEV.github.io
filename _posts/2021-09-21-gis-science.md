## Discussion

1. What is science?
1. Should GIS be considered a science?
1. Is the predominant representation of GIS (St Martin and Wing 2007)
 problematic?
1. To what extent does Open Source / Open Science contradict or support
the predominant representation of GIS?

In preparation for/response to the debate, please prepare a reflection/position statement in a blog-style post on your GitHub site.
Specifically, you might reflect on:
- Which category of **"GIS as Science"** most applies to your **personal experience thus far** using and studying GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as **"science"**?

### Three Positions on GIS as Science (Wright et al 1997)

1. GIS is a Scientific Tool
2. GIS is Toolmaking for Science
3. GIS is a Science

### Four components of GIS Discourse (St. Martin and Wing 2007)

1. Singular technology
2. Progressing along a linear path
3. Inherently expansive and growing
4. Universally applicable
