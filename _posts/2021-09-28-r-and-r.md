## Discussion

In preparation for/response to the debate, please prepare a reflection/position statement on the two questions in the form of a blog-style post on your GitHub site.
Specifically, you might reflect on:
1. To what extent does **open source GIS** help solve the problems of the **reproducibility crisis for geography**? How?
2. Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?
