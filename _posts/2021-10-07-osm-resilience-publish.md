## Expectations

The purpose of this workshop is to help you publish your Urban Resilience project from the previous lab as a research compendium. Therefore, there is no separate deliverable due to be graded for this workshop, as the work is folding into your [OSM and PostGIS for Urban Resilience](OSM-resilience-implement) lab.

**revise the expectations to conform to our research repository format**

- Work independently or in pairs, but publish the final results to both students' GitHub pages.
- Publish final result in the form of an interactive Leaflet map.
- If working in pairs, complement the Leaflet map with a static map designed for a static web view or and/for printing.
- Layers with large numbers of features will have difficulty displaying in a Leaflet map, so you might want to focus on displaying results aggregated by Ward or Subward, and for illustrative purposes select underlying features for particularly interesting wards for display.
- The lab report should include the following sections:
  - Question
  - Data & data citations & descriptions
  - Methods (verbal description of analysis with SQL code blocks, with sufficient explanation and detail to be reproduced)
  - Results (interpretation, with link to Leaflet map and any static maps)
