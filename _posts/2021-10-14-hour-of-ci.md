## Spatial Python cyberinfrastructure tutorial

<img src="/assets/hourofCI.png" width=100>

- Please complete the [Hour of CI](https://www.hourofci.org/) **Gateway Lesson**.
- Use the google form at the end to provide feedback to the developers.
- You can access the lesson with a user name and password that I emailed to you on May 4
- The aim of this Hour of CI tutorial is to build and recognize fundamental cyberliteracy (figure below) and introduce you to fundamental spatial python.

In the tutorial, if you cannot tolerate choropleth maps of totals **(and you shouldn't)**...

```python
merged['pctcases'] = merged['cases'] / merged['population'] * 100
# switch the column mapped to to pctcases
```

What's coming next? We'll try a reproduction study on the [CyberGISX](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) Cyberinfrastructure Research Platform!

## Spatial data science with python on your own

What if you want to use Python and Jupyter notebooks to practice spatial data science on your local computer, without access to servers like Hour of CI and CyberGISX? You can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and create a local conda environment including Jupyter notebooks and packages for spatial data science. The `pandas` package provides the functions you learned to love in `SQL` and R's `dplyr`/`tidyverse` while the `geopandas` package provides the spatial functions, analogous to `PostGIS` and R's `sf` package.
