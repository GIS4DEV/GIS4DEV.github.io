## Introductory Spatial Python CyberGISX Tutorials

- From [CyberGISX Hub](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/), you can log in to CyberGISX and browse [COVID-19](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/wherecovid-19) and [Community](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebooks) Notebooks
- We can gain a solid introduction to spatial analysis in Python with Jupyter notebooks through a series of tutorial notebooks developed by Rebecca Vandewalle.
- Each notebook has an Open with CyberGISX button, which will copy the notebook contents from its GitHub repository into your personal CyberGISX account and launch the notebook.
- Let's try three introductory notebooks, in this sequence:
- [Jupyter Notebooks Quick Start](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/jupyter-notebooks-quick-start-2/)
- [Introduction to Python Programming](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/introduction-to-python-programming/)
- [Python file for notetaking](/assets/python-intro.py)
- [Python Geospatial Libraries](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/python-geospatial-libraries/)

## What's next?

What's coming next after break? We'll try a reproduction study of Kang et al (2020) on the [CyberGISX](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) Cyberinfrastructure Research Platform!

Kang, J. Y., A. Michels, F. Lyu, Shaohua Wang, N. Agbodo, V. L. Freeman, and Shaowen Wang. 2020. Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA. *International Journal of Health Geographics* 19 (1):1â€“17.
