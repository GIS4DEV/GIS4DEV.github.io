## Reading

Kang, J. Y., A. Michels, F. Lyu, Shaohua Wang, N. Agbodo, V. L. Freeman, and Shaowen Wang. 2020. Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA. *International Journal of Health Geographics* 19 (1):1â€“17. DOI:[10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x).

## Analysis

To the best of your ability, draw or outline a workflow for this analysis. You may work in partners or small groups on this task.

- The paper describes the analysis and cyberinfrastructure behind the spatial access component of this [Where COVID-19 dashboard for Illinois](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/spatialAccess.html)
- Derrick Burt and Kufre Udoh completed a [reproduction and replication](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/blog/middlebury-college-students-reproduce-and-replicate-covid-19-health-care-resource-accessibility-study/) of the study
- Since that time, the authors have continued to update the code in the [Jupyter notebook for the study](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebook/rapidly-measuring-spatial-accessibility-of-covid-19-healthcare-resources-a-case-study-of-illinois-usa/) on CyberGISX
- [CyberGISX](https://cybergisx.cigi.illinois.edu) is a geospatial cyberinfrastructure project at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](https://cybergis.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, funded by the National Science Foundation and directed by Dr. Shaowen Wang. It is set up to run [Juypter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) using [Python](https://www.python.org/) with a suite of pre-installed packages for data science and spatial analysis.
- CyberGISX is a prime example of [geospatial cyberinfrastructure](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/cyberinfrastructure)

## API: Application Program Interface

This analysis makes use of multiple APIs, including access to data from the Census and from OpenStreetMap.
An API is an interface for passing data or commands between different software programs ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API))

- [DHS Surveys](https://api.dhsprogram.com)
- [Census](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)
- [OpenStreetMap Overpass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)
- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/api/3.10/)
- [GRASS](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_GIS_APIs)
- [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)
- [Google Earth Engine](https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/)

If an API is useful for data science, it is very common to find packages facilitating connection to the API from Python or R.

- [rdhs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rdhs)
- [tidycensus](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidycensus)
- [osmdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgrass7/index.html)
- [rtweet](https://cran.rstudio.com/package=rtweet)
- [rqgis](https://github.com/r-spatial/RQGIS)
- [rgrass7](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgrass7/index.html)

Additionally, if a data course is useful for data science, it's common to find an R package specific to loading that data source. For example:

- [GADMTools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GADMTools) for [GADM](https://gadm.org/)
- [rnaturalearth](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnaturalearth) for [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
