## Reflecting

Please prepare a short blog post for your site from the perspective of an undergraduate student learning spatial analysis with reproducible research notebooks in a CyberGIS environment, e.g. [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/)
Draw on specific examples from the Kang et al (2020) accessibility study and its associated research compendium and computational notebooks.
Does the reproduction study with a research compendium in CyberGIS facilitate learning spatial analysis? How?
Are there ways in which the research compendium could be improved to better facilitate learning? How?

### Big Code

Serge Rey gave a great talk at the 2020 AAG Annual Meeting on [Big Code](https://aag.secure-abstracts.com/AAG%20Annual%20Meeting%202021/sessions-gallery/27052) in which he referenced the importance of [code as text](open-science), discussed issues of inclusivity and algorithmic bias in spatial analysis at length, and considered the potential for open source spatial analysis code to become a means for co-production of algorithmic knowledge with communities that have historically been excluded from the field (a very white male crowd).
