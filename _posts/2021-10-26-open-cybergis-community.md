## Lecture and Notes

1. Webinar to be posted: lecture on CyberGISX and Reproducibility

## Reflecting

1. We have Big Data. Is it time for [Big Code](https://aag.secure-abstracts.com/AAG%20Annual%20Meeting%202021/sessions-gallery/27052)?
2. How far does [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/) get us?

## Big Code

Serge Rey gave a great talk at the 2020 AAG Annual Meeting on [Big Code](https://aag.secure-abstracts.com/AAG%20Annual%20Meeting%202021/sessions-gallery/27052) in which he referenced the importance of [code as text](open-science), discussed issues of inclusivity and algorithmic bias in spatial analysis at length, and considered the potential for open source spatial analysis code to become a means for co-production of algorithmic knowledge with communities that have historically been excluded from the field (a very white male crowd).
