## Tutorial

- In class orientation to RStudio
- [R for Geospatial Processing workshop](https://bakaniko.github.io/FOSS4G2019_Geoprocessing_with_R_workshop/) presented by Nicolas Roelandt in Bucharest, Romania. Here's the [repository](https://github.com/Bakaniko/FOSS4G2019_Geoprocessing_with_R_workshop)

## Essential libraries

- [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) provides support for spatial vector data implementing the OSGeo *simple features*  standards we are accustomed to
- [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp) a separate package for spatial vector data
- [stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) spatial-temporal raster data in R
- [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster) another raster data package
- [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) thematic maps, including leaflet maps
- [mapsf](https://riatelab.github.io/mapsf/) package for static map cartography (replaces the old cartography package) mapsf [presentation slides with vignettes](https://rcarto.github.io/user2021)
