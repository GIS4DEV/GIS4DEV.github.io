## Reading

2. Tate, E. 2013. Uncertainty Analysis for a Social Vulnerability Index. *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* 103 (3):526–543. DOI:[10.1080/00045608.2012.700616](https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2012.700616).

## Discussion

As you read Tate (2013), consider the following:

- Which of the model structures described by Tate was used in Malcomb et al (2014)?
- What decisions were made by Malcomb et al (2014) at each of the steps illustrated by Tate in Figure 1, and elaborated in the *Sources of Uncertainty* section?
- Does Tate give you any ideas about how to evaluate your reproduction of the Malcomb et al (2014) study in terms of:
  - sources of uncertainty (never hurts to [double-check](https://youtu.be/tj7RlQdF25A))
  - methods to compare your results with the original study results

Write down your notes as you read and as we discuss the paper in class so that you can use them in your report on the Malcomb et al (2014) reproduction. You don't need a separate blog post for this, but you do need to learn from and cite Tate's paper in your report on the Malcomb et al (2014) reproduction.

Add to the **original study** information in your replication report your interpretation on the type of vulnerability model Malcomb et al (2014) have used. Add to the **discussion** section of your replication report any important sources of uncertainty you have learned about with regards to the Malcomb et al (2014) study.
