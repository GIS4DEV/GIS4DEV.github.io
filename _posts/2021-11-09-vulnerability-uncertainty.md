## Reading

Tate, E. 2013. Uncertainty Analysis for a Social Vulnerability Index. *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* 103 (3):526–543. DOI:[10.1080/00045608.2012.700616](https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2012.700616).

Use this [handout](/assets/vulnerability-model-uncertainty.pdf) to guide your reading and your analysis of Malcomb et al (2014) in relation to Tate's (2013) framework.

## Discussion & Blog

The discussion and blog for this week should critique the Malcomb et al (2014) study using the framework of Tate (2013) and taking advantage of our [reproduction study](https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Malcomb-2014), including any results, data, metadata, and pre-analysis plan in the reproduction study.

There are many sources of error, uncertainty, and irreproducibility in the original study. In your post, please review the overall research design of Malcomb et al in terms of Tate's framework and focus on what you think are the more important problems with the study.
