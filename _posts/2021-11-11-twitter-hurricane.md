Similar to the strategy with Malcomb et al, we'll first focus on executing and studying a worked example of code, and then we'll focus on improving the analysis & applying to a new case: assessing whether the spatial distribution of original tweets represents a fake tweet storm or the real risk and impact of [Hurricane Dorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian)
