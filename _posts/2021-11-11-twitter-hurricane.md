To begin learning how to analyze Twitter data, we will first focus on executing and studying a worked example of code investigating the spatial distribution of original tweets represents a fake tweet storm or the real risk and impact of [Hurricane Dorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian). Next week, we will replicate the Hurricane Dorian study with new independent analyses of Twitter data.

This week, please:

1. `Fork` and then `clone` the `[OE-Dorian](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/OR-Dorian)` repository.
1. Download [dorian_raw.RData](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/geog323data/raw/main/dorian/dorian_raw.RDS) into the `data/raw/private` folder
1. Download [november_raw.RData](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/geog323data/raw/main/dorian/november_raw.RDS) into the `data/raw/private` folder
