## Reading

Crawford, K., and M. Finn. 2014. The limits of crisis data: analytical and ethical challenges of using social and mobile data to understand disasters. GeoJournal 80 (4):491â€“502. DOI:[10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z](https://10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z)

## Discussion & Blog Post

Consider the arguments of the Crawford & Finn (2014) article as you interpret your findings from the [Hurricane Dorian](/2021-11-11-tiwtter-hurricane) analysis.

- What types of uncertainty are most prevalent in the use of VGI (volunteered geographic information, e.g. geocoded Tweets) for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
- Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
- Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?
