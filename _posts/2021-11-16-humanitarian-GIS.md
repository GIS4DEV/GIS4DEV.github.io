## Discussion & Blog Post

Consider the arguments of the Crawford & Finn (2014) article as you interpret your findings from the [Hurricane Dorian](/2021/11/11/twitter-hurricane) analysis.

- What types of uncertainty are most prevalent in the use of VGI (volunteered geographic information, e.g. geocoded Tweets) for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
- Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
- Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?
