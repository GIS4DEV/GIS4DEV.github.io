## Reading

Crawford, K., and M. Finn. 2014. The limits of crisis data: analytical and ethical challenges of using social and mobile data to understand disasters. GeoJournal 80 (4):491â€“502. DOI:[10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z](https://10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z)

## Discussion

Consider the Craford & Finn (2014) article and any of the crowd-sourced / volunteered geographic information (VGI) you have already worked with personally (e.g. Twitter, OpenStreetMap) in relation to Longley et al's framework of uncertainty filters in the process of geograaphic research.

- What types of uncertainty are most prevalent in the use of VGI for research on disasters and humanitarian crises?
- Do you think that there is any ethical obligation in relation to uncertainty?
- Or, do you think that there are ethical concerns in using VGI that complicate uncertainty?
