- Modify your `RE-Dorian` repository to query your own set of data from Twitter.
- You may modify both the search terms and the geographic extent of the search.
- Remember that you may have to let the query run for a few hours if there are a high number of results.
- This type of analysis is highly dependent on trending twitter activity over the past week. Create a query that will result in many thousands of tweets in the United States.
- You may also want a second query to establish a baseline of normal twitter activity not related to your search. This could be an identical query that simply removes the search term constraints, or an identical query that finds the inverse of the search terms (i.e. all tweets that *do not* contain any of the keyword search terms). This second query will enable you to calculate a normalized tweet difference index.
- If you are interested in analyzing Hurricane Ida data, the code for searches is available [here](https://www.github.com/GIS4DEV/OR-Ida) (currently a private repository for Middlebury students)
