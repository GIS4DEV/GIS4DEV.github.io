We will take this meeting time to review one another's work in the course thus far.

### Overall Site

- Is there a good main page, raising interest in both the person (as a potential employeeâ€¦) and the content (evidence of an intellectual GIS maverick?)
- Is the site functional with working links and easy navigation?
- Is the site following an honor code of sharing, reproducibility, and attribution of work?

### Blog Posts

- Is there a post for each non-lab week of the course?
- Do posts cite appropriate readings?
- Is any proofreading / revision necessary?
- Are posts related to a workshop activity using data for that workshop and linking to relevant repositories?
- There are *six* posts thus far:
  - What is Open GIScience?
  - Open Source GIS & Reproducibility
  - Error & Uncertainty
  - Open CyberGIS Community
  - Malawi Vulnerability Model & Uncertainty
  - Humanitarian GIS

### Labs

- For each lab analysis, is there clear and legible:
  - purpose
  - methodology
  - data availability and metadata / data citations
  - code
  - visualization of results
  - interpretation of results in relation to relevant course readings?
- Have each of the lab analyses been published with a Git repository?
- Can any steps be taken to improve reproducibility of the analyses?
- There are *three* labs thus far:
  - Dar es Salaam Resilience in PostGIS SQL
  - Chicago COVID-19 Spatial Accessibility in Python
  - Twitter Disasters in R
