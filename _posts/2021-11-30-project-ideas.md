title: "Independent Project Ideas"
purpose: "generate feasible ideas for an independent project"
format: lecture

During this lesson, we will discuss and decide upon project ideas. Projects should be similar in difficulty and scope to one of the four labs this semester, and should encompass a research study using spatial analysis with open source GIS technology.

### Project Ideas

Options for identifying interesting and feasible project ideas include:

- Attempting to reproduce a straightforward published research study, especially one published with data and code, or with easily accessible public data sources. Reproduction will likely include some degree of reanalysis, in which some parameters of the study are intentionally changed to improve study design or faciliate learning.
- Develop a project to learn a new package or technology for geospatial analysis or visualization.
- Replicate an existing study by substantially changing the geographic and/or temporal context

### Requirements and Expectations

- The independent project will be due with the final GitHub site portfolio, during finals week.
- Projects may be completed in PostGIS, Python, or R. Other languages or open GIS systems may be possible with approval.
- Projects should include a **reproducible research compendium** in the form of a GitHub respository, paired with a report/blog post on your main GitHub site.
- You may ask the professor for feedback on the project up to the first day of finals week.
- Finalize a project concept with the professor by **December 9**.
