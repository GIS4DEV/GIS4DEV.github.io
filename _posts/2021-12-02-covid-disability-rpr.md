The purpose of this workshop is to reproduce Chakraborty (2021) and in doing so, learn about spatial scan statistics for epidemiology and about generalized estimating equations.

Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. *Disability and Health Journal* 14 (1):101007. DOI: [10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007).

## Procedure

- **fork** the [HEGSRR/RPr-Chakraborty-2021](https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Chakraborty-2021) repository to your own GitHub account
- **clone** the repository to your local machine
- **execute** the analysis
- **comment** any potential errors, uncertainties, or opportunities for improvement
- **compare** results to the original publication
- **write** a final blog post for the course illustrating and interpreting the reproduction results. Include visuals of your results and a link to your version of the repository. In particular, please address these questions:
  - Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
  - If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
  - Are there opportunities to further improve the study's research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
  - Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
