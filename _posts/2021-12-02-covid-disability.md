## Reading

1. Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. *Disability and Health Journal* 14 (1):101007. DOI: [10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007).

## Lecture and Discussion

For this lecture, please read Chakraborty's (2021) paper thoroughly with the intention of understanding the research methodology. Some of the individual research techniques will be new to you, so try to understand them as well as possible through context clues: what are the inputs, parameters, and outputs of the new techniques?
