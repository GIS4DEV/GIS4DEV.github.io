/* FIRST, follow the Panopto videos to get connected to the database, get connected to ResilienceAcademy's web feature services, and load data into the database.
The final video, OSM to PostGIS, is opotional! */

/* SECOND, try downloading the population by ward excel table on your own from the Humanitarian Data Exchange resource above.
Load it into QGIS first, and then into PostGIS, giving it the table name: census
Remember to use only lower case table names and field names! */

/* NOW, we're ready to start using SQL queries to investigate the data! 
Our ultimate goal will be to find the population density of wards and the percentage of area flooded in each ward, but we'll have some diversions along the way to learn more about spatial SQL.

I suggest opening this file in Notepad++ or Atom to see the text styled according to the SQL language. 
Each SQL query ends in a semicolon; and you can copy these to DB Manager and execute (F5 key) one at a time to see the results.

/* IT'S TIME FOR OVERLAY ANALYSIS! LETS DO AN INTERSECTION, which is really a JOIN based on LOCATION while also modifying the GEOMETRY DATA. This may take time because of the complexity of a dissolved flood layer.

/*
The ST_MULTI() function was added to cast each geometry as multi-geometry type. Since we don't know if we'll get single- or multi-part features out of an intersection and all of the geometries have to be of the same type, it's safest to wrap an st_multi() function around most geometry-altering queries.

You can add the results of this query to the QGIS map using the Load as new layer option at the bottom of the results, and set the Geometry column to geom.
It looks good, so let's make it a new table named ward_flood. Try this on your own, and then drop the old utmgeom column from that new table.
