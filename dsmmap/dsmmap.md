<a href="index.html" target="_blank">View full-size map</a>

This map was created with the QGIS Plugin <a href="https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web" target="_blank">qgis2web</a>, built using the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> JavaScript library for mapping.

The code below should be a qgis2web leaflet map, and I think that it is not working because the CSS files need to be included in the HTML page header. This is going to take some more work, as explained [here](https://dieghernan.github.io/201905_Leaflet_R_Jekyll/)

Until next time...
