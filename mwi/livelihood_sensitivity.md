title: Malcomb et al FEWSnet Data
---


### Questions
- Restrictions about redistribution to a) class, b) public
- Was this data ever publically available?
- How available is this data for other countries? More recent surveys? Malcomb et al states that it is available in 23 countries.


### Variables
- based on interviews with MVAC and data created in partership with FEWSNET
- in 2003, MVAC conducted a livelihood rezoning exercise and Household Economy Approach (HEA) baseline survey for 11 livelihood zones
- wealth groups of POOR, MIDDLE, and BETTER-OFF created
- Table 2 references "FEWSNET 2005"
- It seems like the universe of survey data for several indicators is the "POOR" group.
- It seems that the unit of analysis is the 11 livelihood zones as "The use of these zones as one component of the overall composite vulnerability index helped to smooth the boundaries of TAs used in teh assets and access analysis. Similar livelihood data is available in 23 countries."
