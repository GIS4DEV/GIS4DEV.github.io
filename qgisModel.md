title: My First QGIS Model
---

Just a sample page, to illustrate the idea.

In the first lab in Spring 2019, we created a model to calculate direction and distance from a point.

```bat
:: testing representation of Batch code in GitHub pages
:: Run Sink Drainage Route Detection
saga_cmd ta_preprocessor 1 -ELEVATION=W:\lab04\mos2Mosaic_reclassified.sgrd -SINKROUTE=%od%/%pre%sinkroutes.sgrd
```
