title: My First QGIS Model

Just a sample page, to illustrate the idea.

Be aware, when you commit changes to your .md documents using GitHub sites with Jekyll themes, it can take several minutes before your changes are reflected in the rendered .html pages.

In the first lab in Spring 2019, we created a model to calculate direction and distance from a point.

```bat
:: testing representation of Batch code in GitHub pages
:: Run Sink Drainage Route Detection
saga_cmd ta_preprocessor 1 -ELEVATION=W:\lab04\mos2Mosaic_reclassified.sgrd -SINKROUTE=%od%/%pre%sinkroutes.sgrd
```
